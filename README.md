first fo all i learnt about how to make a call 
then i leant how to make call on the user's choice 


// infinite scrolling 
with the help IntersectionObserver object ;
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, options);

1. callback

A function that runs whenever the visibility of the target changes.
It receives two arguments:
entries â†’ Array of IntersectionObserverEntry objects (info about each observed element).
observer â†’ The observer instance itself.

each entry has these properties 
entry.target â†’ The observed element
entry.isIntersecting â†’ true/false if visible
entry.intersectionRatio â†’ Percentage of visibility (0 to 1)
entry.boundingClientRect â†’ Elementâ€™s position/size
entry.intersectionRect â†’ Visible part of the element
entry.rootBounds â†’ Bounds of the root element
const callback = (entries, observer) =>
{
    entries.forEach(entry=>{
        if(entry.in)
    })
}

#isInterSecting
isIntersecting is a boolean (true/false).
It tells you whether the target element is currently intersecting (overlapping) with the root (viewport or parent element).

ðŸ”¹ How it works

If any part of the element crosses the threshold into the root, isIntersecting = true.

If itâ€™s completely outside, then isIntersecting = false.

#useRef
const ref = useRef(null);

Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render. This means refs are perfect for storing information that doesnâ€™t affect the visual output of your component. For example, if you need to store an interval ID and retrieve it later, you can put it in a ref. To update the value inside the ref, you need to manually change its current property:

Manipulating the DOM with useRef
When you pass a ref to a React element (via the ref prop), React will set .current to that DOM nod
